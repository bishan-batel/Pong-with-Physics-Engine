# Pong-with-Physics-Engine

Only had 2 modes : singleplayer and multiplayer.
Singleplayer is against a very primitive AI agent I wrote, multiplayer is just splitscreen.

Singleplayer Controls:

W & S -> Forward and Back
A & D -> Left and Right

Multiplayer Controls:

W & S -> Forward and Back (Player1)
A & D -> Left and Right (Player1)

UP_ARROW & DOWN_ARROW -> Forward and Back (Player2)
LEFT_ARROW & RIGHT_ARROW -> Left and Right (Player2)
